1 Abstract
Our aim was to create a web application to visualize different characterstics of FIFA-2020 dataset.The
project provides an easy to use interface which helps the users to display the number of players
according to their country on the world map. Although the display alone is not enough and there
are other questions that we answer for the users in this app. We have used various kinds of charts
and graphs to answer these questions.The application is built from scratch and we haven‚Äôt used any
kind of template. All the charts are created from using Google chart Javascript.


2 Introduction
2.1 Application Domain
The project is specifically targeting the audience who are enthusiast to know even subtle information
about football. Although visualizations are made taking into account the various aspects of
only football game, this website can be extended to several other domains as well due to its ease of
use from user perspective and ease of extension from the developer perspective. Use of this project
depends on the data being used for displaying the visualization.

2.2 Questions of Interest with their answers
 To know the regions where football is more popular.We have developed an GeoChart visualization
with map where user can directly visualise which region has more number of players
according to the color density on map (dark green color means more dense area for number
of players and light green means less dense area).We can directly co-relate the number
of players coming from the area to the popularity of the football.User can also hover over
specific region of interest to identify region name and the number of players in that specific
region.We can observe that clusters of regions with high density of players are in South
America and Europe where the sport is popular.
 User can get the idea for the wages of player according to his position in the club.We have
visualised this wage component on a pie chart and visualised positions in different colors
along with their discriptions.Various categories include SUB(substitute),RES(reserve) etc.
and user has to simple hover over the specific region in pie chart to know various details
such as category,wage and so on.There are in total 27 positions of players that are plotted on
pie chart. We can infer that clubs spend their majority of wages on SUBstitutes and REServe
players.
 To display the relation between age of player and its overall rating , we used scatter plot for
plotting the relation.User can easily conclude that which age category has the most skilled
players (players whose rating is usually ¬ø 85) and vice-versa.We can infer from the scatter
plot the various clusters which lie as an outliers from the data. Players with high overall
rating and younger in age are less which can be observed from data. Players with very high
rating are oftenly in the prime of their careers so are between age 27 to 34.

 From the data we wanted to know the top clubs in the dataset.For the clubs part,we tried to
visualise various details using the players belonging to particular club using bubble chart.As
players are paid according to their capability, by hovering over bubbles, user can infer which
club has how many players,their wage in euros and the estimated value of all the players of
that particular club. After Visualization, We could see that clubs which having high wage
structure and combined value of the players are playing much better football than their peers.

 We used the potential attribute in the dataset to answer how clubs are valuing the players
with high potential in the transfer market.We tried to answer this question using line
graph.Usually players in 30‚Äôs are near to their retirement so we considered players whose
age is near ¬°25 (young players).It can be easily visualised that player whose potential rating
is less or equal to 85 (which is a good rating) has steady increase in their worth and after that
slope becomes large as value is increasing more drastically wrt to player‚Äôs potential above
85.We could see that players with potential between 80 to 88 are greater in numbers with
low estimated value. As the potential for the player increases so does the value for the club.
2.3 Dataset Used

 We used dataset from the source https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-completeplayer-
dataset which is publically available
 The size is approximately 48 MB and has 18K+ rows.
 We have preprocessed the data according to the requirements of the project.We have removed
the columns for attributes which were not relevant for the visualization.

3 Project Status
As of now, we have accompalished all the targets which we decided early.Only thing we are working
on presently is the designing part using CSS which we will be able to complete before our
presentation.
                     
4 Development Environment
4.1 Basic Framework
NPM(Node Package Manager) is used for this platform for handling dependencies. Node.js is
used for server-side scripting. Node will act as a web server for this application and will be used
for the routing application.Packages used in the node are
 Express
 MySQL
Package MySQL is used to connect node.js with the backend MySQL database. Data is load
into MySQL workbench (database) installed locally from csv file.This is connect with node server
using the MySQL db details such as credentials,port number and database name.
Google charts are used to get various charts and maps for data visualization.These are powerful,
simple to use, and free tools.
3
EJS(Embedded JavaScript) is used for creating webpage as it has the luxury to add javascript
content and HTML content inline.
Initially, a request is sent to server.js which act as server side of the project. This file interacts
with the database and does necessary computations. The file also deals with setting up of listening
PORT to run on the server and also routes various requests to corresponding functions. Default
route of the application will redirect the user to index.html file.
This is a web page application, and the default route will display the results as per default
input.It will display a world map where a user can hover over the regions to get no.of players and
poplularity of game in that particular region.
 Go the folder containing server.js file.
 Open command prompt from that folder.
 Run ‚Äúnode server.js‚Äù in the command prompt.
 The listening PORT address will be displayed in the command window and minimise this
window.
 Go to browser and type url for the browser is ‚Äúhttps://localhost:8080/‚Äù.

5 Concluding Remarks
Our team has been able to complete all the objectives we initially set up for ourselves except designing.
We did the designing ourselves without relying on any external prebuilt template. We
tried to include all the visualizations that we thought would help the user in efficiently navigating
through the data and the problem set we chose. Graphic Visualizations are much more intuitive and
gives better representation of the data. Graphics can give insight with much less effort as compared
to raw data.
Future Scope: There are few more options that could help the user make the best decision.
Application can be made more dynamic and scope can be extended to other sports as well
as non-sports categories as well.Also , data from various years can be used to compare different
trends between them using various charts
